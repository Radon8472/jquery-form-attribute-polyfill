JQuery Polyfill for browsers without [form attribute] support

The initial code was collected from Stackoverflow.com Answers in
- [Polyfill HTML5 form attribute]
- [Internet Explorer issue with HTML5 form attribute]


In this Repository I try to merge features of answers to create the best code,
and rebuild full usebility of [form attribute] on older browser (e.g. InternetExplorer).
